This plugin checks the IP addresses of site visitors against listings in the Project Honey Pot blacklist (http:bl). Currently, this is done only for logged-out visitors (+ bots/crawlers etc.) who visit the Login, Register or Lost Password pages. If a possible threatening IP is identified, it gets either blocked from accessing these pages or you can also redirect the access to a honeypot site that you have created.

For the plugin to work you need to register a (free) personal account at http://www.projecthoneypot.org and create your API key.



Installation:

1. Copy the http_blacklist plugin folder into you mod folder,
2. Enable the http:Blacklist plugin in the admin section of your site,
3. Enter at least your http:bl API key on the plugin's settings page.



Changelog:
